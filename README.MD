- **Separation of concerns**: Each layer has a single responsibility.
- **Dependency inversion**: The inner layers do not depend on the outer layers.
- **Testability**: The business rules can be tested without the need of external dependencies.
- **Independence of frameworks**: The application can be easily migrated to another framework.
- **Independence of UI**: The application can be easily migrated to another UI (web, mobile, etc).
- **Independence of database**: The application can be easily migrated to another database.
- **Independence of external services**: The application can be easily migrated to another external service.
- **Independence of external libraries**: The application can be easily migrated to another library.
- **Independence of the development team**: The application can be easily maintained by another team.
- **Scalability**: The application can be easily scaled horizontally.
- **Maintainability**: The application can be easily maintained.
- **Simplicity**: The application is simple to understand and to maintain.
- **Flexibility**: The application can be easily extended.
- **Robustness**: The application can handle errors gracefully.
- **Performance**: The application has a good performance.
- **Security**: The application is secure.
- **Quality**: The application has a good quality.
- **Clean code**: The code is clean and easy to understand.
- **Best practices**: The code follows the best practices.
